Save editor for ASTLIBRA Revision. Except there's no interface at all, and very limited functionality, so it's more of a proof-of-concept than anything.

The original motivation behind this was to avoid needing to grind for weapon recipes and materials. While this is a great game, that's just something I can't stand, so I wanted to be able to skip that part.

Granting materials is easy. I never did figure out exactly how recipe unlocks work. I have plenty of notes but did not succeed in unlocking recipes when I tried it. And due to late-game events, this ended up being a non-issue. If I go back and do an Impossible playthrough I'll try again.

I was not able to extract data from the game archives. I'm pretty sure they use the default dxlib password, but with modifications, and I'm not good enough at reverse engineering to figure out exactly what changed. Or, rather, I lack the patience. All items and equipment are manually extracted; there may be errors. And there's a lot of missing data.

There's a lot of placeholder code. I don't intend on going back to this unless I start an Impossible playthrough. It is at least capable of granting copies of items, force, gold, and partner experience.
